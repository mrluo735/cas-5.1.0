# Thanks

We want to start off by saying thank you for using CAS. This project is a labor of love, and we appreciate all contribution
that provide pull requests, make performance improvements and help with documentation. Every contribution is meaningful, so thank you 
for participating. 

That being said, here are a few guidelines that we ask you to follow so we can successfully address your issue.

# Stop

In order to streamline the process of evaluating issues, we ask that you:

- First, check with CAS' user mailing list and other support forums to see if the issue has been reported there and if there are any workarounds.
- Cross check with the official CAS documentation to see if there are any missing steps in your configuration.
- Check CAS' issue tracker to see if your issue has already been reported.

# Contribute

If you have already identified an enhancement or a bug fix, it is STRONGLY recommended that you simply submit a pull request to address the case. There is no need for special ceremony to create separate issues.
The pull request IS the issue and it will be tracked and tagged as such. Do NOT log issues hoping for the issue to get resolved in the future by someone else. [Study the guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and learn the skills to submit contributions, or reach out to a [commercial affiliate](https://www.apereo.org/content/commercial-affiliates) for assistance.

# Remember

- If you have a question about how to configure a feature in CAS, please use the CAS mailing lists instead or other support channels. 
- If your submission is not an actual issue or does not carry enough diagnostic data described and enumerated below, the issue may be automatically tagged and closed.
- **Important:** Be prepared to test, contribute, follow through, engage and provide patches and pull requests. 

# To Reproduce

When and where appropriate, please submit your CAS configuration/overlay to this project [in form of a pull request](https://github.com/cas-projects/cas-issues/) so we could easily evaluate your deployment configuration to reproduce the issue.

# Issue Report

Remove the above from the issue description and make sure the following checklist is followed:

- [] CAS server version
- [] Container/environment type/version (Tomcat, Jetty, Java, Linux/Windows, etc)
- [] Steps to duplicate the problem along with your CAS settings and properties
- [] Stacktraces and CAS DEBUG logs where appropriate.
- [] Configuration/Overlay pushed to https://github.com/cas-projects/cas-issues/ or attached to the issue.
